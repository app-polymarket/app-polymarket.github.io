                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>The Technology Behind Polymarket</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. Blockchain Infrastructure<br>Polymarket is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which enables the platform to benefit from Ethereum’s established security, decentralized nature, and extensive network of users. Smart contracts govern every transaction on Polymarket, ensuring that user funds are held securely and that outcomes are executed automatically.<br><br>2. Smart Contracts<br>Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that operate on blockchain technology. In the context of Polymarket, smart contracts facilitate:<br><br>Market Creation: Users can create markets for a specific event, setting the parameters and outcomes.<br>Bet Settlement: Once an event concludes, the smart contract automatically distributes winnings based on the verified outcome.<br>3. Oracles for Data Verification<br>To determine the outcomes of events, Polymarket relies on decentralized oracles that pull data from trustworthy sources. These oracles ensure accuracy by cross-referencing various data inputs before finalizing outcomes.<br><br>4. Liquidity Protocol<br>Polymarket employs a liquidity protocol that maintains an order book, allowing users to trade shares of outcomes easily, enhancing the overall user experience. This liquidity ensures that users can enter and exit positions quickly and with minimal slippage.</p>
